## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies machine learning to predict diabetes risk using U.S. public health survey data and evaluates the fairness and policy implications of these predictions. Beyond model performance, the project emphasizes:

- Health equity analysis  
- Algorithmic fairness  
- High-risk population identification  
- Public health policy simulation  

The goal is to demonstrate how applied machine learning can inform **evidence-based public health policy and intervention design**.

## 📊 Dataset

**Source:** Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)  
**Dataset:** Diabetes Health Indicators (2015)  
**Size:** ~250,000 observations  
**Features:** 22 behavioral, health, and socioeconomic variables  

**Target Variable:**
- `Diabetes_binary`
  - `1` = Diagnosed diabetes  
  - `0` = No diabetes  

Key predictors include:
- BMI  
- High blood pressure  
- Physical & mental health

## ⚙️ Methods & Models

Three supervised learning models were trained and compared:

1. **Logistic Regression** (baseline)
2. **Random Forest**
3. **Gradient Boosting** (final selected model)

### Performance Metrics:
- Accuracy  
- ROC–AUC  
- Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Feature importance  

Gradient Boosting achieved the **highest ROC–AUC** and was used for the fairness and policy simulation analysis.

## 🔍 Fairness & Equity Analysis

Model predictions were evaluated across:

- **Sex**
- **Income**

Key findings:
- Males exhibited higher predicted diabetes risk.
- Diabetes risk declined steadily with increasing income.
- Individuals with healthcare access showed higher observed risk due to **diagnosis detection bias**, not true increased disease prevalence.

---

## 🚀 Policy Simulation

A hypothetical **BMI reduction intervention** was simulated:

> A uniform 1-unit decrease in BMI across the population.

Results demonstrated:
- A measurable reduction in predicted diabetes risk
- Larger benefits concentrated in lower-income populations
- Evidence that behavioral interventions may reduce health inequities
