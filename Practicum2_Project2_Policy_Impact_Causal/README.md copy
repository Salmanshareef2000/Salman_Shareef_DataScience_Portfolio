## 📌 Project Overview

This practicum project develops and evaluates a **deep learning–based regression system** to predict **median housing prices in California** using socioeconomic and geographic census features.

Four models were implemented and compared:

- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)**
- **k-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)**
- **Baseline Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)**
- **Improved Multilayer Perceptron (BatchNorm + Dropout)**

The **Baseline MLP achieved the best performance (R² ≈ 0.78)**, showing that deep learning effectively captures nonlinear housing market relationships.

This project is suitable for:

- Deep Learning final project  
- Applied Practicum 2 submission  
- GitHub portfolio showcase

## 🧠 Business & Real-World Applications

The predictive system can support:

- **Real estate investors** – identify undervalued markets  
- **Banks & lenders** – reduce mortgage underwriting risk  
- **Urban planners** – detect housing demand & pressure zones  
- **Affordable housing agencies** – monitor economic constraints

📈 Model Evaluation Metrics

Models were compared using:
R² – variance explained
Adjusted R² – penalized complexity
RMSE – root mean squared error
MAE – mean absolute error

Top model:
Baseline MLP → R² ≈ 0.78
This model balances complexity, generalization, and stability.

🧪 Deep Learning Architecture
Baseline MLP
Dense(64, relu)
Dense(64, relu)
Dense(1)
Optimizer: Adam
Loss: MSE

Improved MLP
Dense(128, relu) → BatchNorm → Dropout(0.3)
Dense(128, relu) → BatchNorm → Dropout(0.3)
Dense(64, relu) → Dropout(0.2)
Dense(1)

🔍 Model Interpretability
🔹 Residual Analysis
Residuals centered around zero
No major heteroscedasticity
Indicates unbiased, stable predictions

🔹 Feature Importance (ExtraTrees)
Top predictors:
Median income
Latitude
Longitude
Room/bedroom averages
Population / occupancy
These reveal strong socioeconomic and geographic effects on price.

⚠️ Limitations
California Housing dataset is from 1990
Lacks modern economic factors (crime, schools, zoning)
Coordinates approximate spatial trends but don’t capture clusters
Deep learning remains somewhat opaque without SHAP/LIME

✅ Key Outcomes
Neural networks outperform classical ML in predictive accuracy
Baseline MLP emerges as the most reliable model
EDA, modeling, evaluation, and interpretation fully implemented
Project demonstrates readiness for real-world deployment
