## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) to large-scale Reddit mental health discussions to:

- Measure emotional sentiment
- Discover latent psychological themes using topic modeling
- Detect high-risk distress signals indicating severe emotional vulnerability

The goal is to demonstrate how computational text analytics can support digital mental health surveillance and public health policy.

## 🧪 Analysis Pipeline

### ✅ Notebook 1 — Data Ingestion & Cleaning  
- Streamed chunk processing (memory safe)
- Removal of spam, empty, deleted posts
- Text normalization & token filtering

### ✅ Notebook 2 — Sentiment Analysis  
- VADER polarity scoring
- Disk-based streaming sentiment computation
- Saved sentiment-enriched dataset

### ✅ Notebook 3 — Topic Modeling (LDA)  
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation
- Dominant psychological topic assignment

### ✅ Notebook 4 — Mental Health Risk Detection  
- High-risk keyword heuristic model
- Negative sentiment risk flagging
- Topic-level and time-based distress trend analysis

## 📊 Key Outputs

- `summary_high_risk_by_topic.csv`
- High-risk trend plots
- Topic-specific distress rankings
- Sentiment distribution visualizations

## ⚠️ Data Availability

Due to GitHub file size limits, the raw Reddit dataset (`>500MB`) and processed row-level CSVs are **not included in this repository**.  
They are generated locally using the notebooks.

## 📜 Ethical Disclaimer

This project performs **probabilistic risk detection only** and is **not a clinical diagnostic tool**. All data are anonymized public Reddit posts. Results are intended solely for research and policy-level insights.
